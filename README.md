## After clone the repository

In the project directory, you can run the following command in terminal/powershell/commad prompt:

### `npm install; npm start `

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3010](http://localhost:3010) to view it in the browser.
**Note: I had to change the default port**

## Not Implemented
1.	Routing was not implemented.<br>
2.	Exception handling was not implemented.

## Some observation
1.	Some fontawsome icons are not found or pro. I used relevant which are free.<br>
2.	Logo as used as character as I donâ€™t have the real image for use or create the svg path.<br>
3.  On mock-up, content margin values are in fractions which prevent to make pixel perfect, <br> 
    event some of the elementâ€™s alignments are not same in some section **[I think itâ€™s only for the test to confuse the candidate ðŸ˜Š]**.<br>
4. Though already mentioned in email, In api json data, images url are not valid so youâ€™ll be seeing the default image.<br> 
   If images are found then real images will appear.
